	<center><p>In case you were wondering, the rumors are true. Hiram does in fact have a criminal record, he was caught speeding without a driver's license. He later escaped secret police custody and posted on his blog that he had the intention of running for mayor. He won over Night Vale almost instantly with his new ideas to improve the community. Unfortunately, former mayor, Pamela Winchell was quick 
	to remind NIght Vale citizens that a five headed dragon could not run for mayor, especially with a criminal record. Unfortunately Hiram continues to face discrimination due to the fact that he’s a five headed dragon, discrimination due to the fact that he’s a five headed dragon, but he will continue to run until he is elected & given the opportunity to make Night Vale a better place.</p></center>
